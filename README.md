# Claude Session Monitor

**See every Claude Code session at a glance — which is working, which is waiting for you, which hit a limit — plus per-session CPU/RAM and your real 5h / 7d usage budget.**

## Why

When you run 10-15 Claude Code tabs at once, you lose track of which one is busy,
which finished and needs your input, and which quietly hit a rate limit. And you
can't see how much of your 5-hour / weekly budget is left until you get throttled.

Claude Session Monitor puts all of that in one Activity Bar panel, live.

## Features

- **Live session list, grouped by state** — Limited / Waiting for you / Your turn /
  Working / Ended. Titles match your tabs; updates in real time.
- **Per-session CPU% + RAM** — see exactly which session is hammering your machine,
  with a total at the top and a 🔥 on CPU hogs. *(macOS/Linux)*
- **Official usage budget** — real **Session (5h)** and **Weekly (7d)** gauges with
  **% used**, **% left**, and a reset countdown, pulled from your own account. Plus a
  **token-usage trend** (rolling 5h / 7d) with an hourly chart. *(official gauges: macOS)*
- **Notifications** — in-VS-Code toasts and native macOS notifications the moment a
  session needs you or hits a limit (even when VS Code isn't focused).
- **Stuck-session alert** — flags a "working" session that has gone silent too long.
- **Staggered Resume All** — after an internet drop, resume every session
  automatically, spaced one per minute so you don't trip the rate limit by resuming
  all at once. Fully automated via keystrokes (no manual typing). *(macOS)*
- **Quality of life** — Activity Bar badge for sessions needing you, a "needs-you
  only" filter, jump to a session's tab on click, and one-click clear/remove of
  ended sessions.

## Install

### From the Marketplace

Search **"Claude Session Monitor"** in the Extensions view, or:

```bash
code --install-extension glossgo.claude-session-monitor
```

### Hook layer (one command)

The status list and per-session CPU/RAM use a tiny hook layer. Run once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glossgo/claude-session-monitor.git
bash claude-session-monitor/scripts/install.sh
```

This copies `hook.py` into `~/.claude/session-monitor/` and merges five status hooks
(SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit / Stop / Notification / SessionEnd) into
`~/.claude/settings.json` (idempotent, with a backup). Reload the VS Code window.

> The official 5h/7d usage gauges need **no hook** — the extension reads them
> directly. Auto-resume needs a one-time macOS **Accessibility** permission for VS
> Code (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility).

## How it works

A pure, `vscode`-free data layer merges three sources per session:

1. **Hook status files** (`~/.claude/session-monitor/<id>.json`) for live state
   ("waiting for you" is only knowable here) and the session's worker PID (for CPU/RAM).
2. **Transcript tail** (`~/.claude/projects/.../<id>.jsonl`) for the title, newest
   conversational state, limit detection, and the token-usage trend. Only interactive
   sessions (`entrypoint = claude-vscode | cli`) are shown.
3. **Official account usage** from `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, using your
   Claude OAuth token from the macOS keychain (`Claude Code-credentials`).

### Privacy

- No telemetry. Nothing is sent anywhere except a **read-only GET of your own account
  usage** to Anthropic (the same call the Claude app makes), and only on macOS.
- The keychain token is read locally to authorize that call and is never stored or
  logged by this extension.
- CPU/RAM come from a local `ps`; auto-resume uses local `osascript` keystrokes.

## Configuration

All settings are under `claudeSessionMonitor.*`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `notifyOnWaiting` | `true` | Notify when a session starts waiting for you |
| `notifyOnLimited` | `true` | Notify when a session hits a limit |
| `notifyOnDone` | `false` | Notify when a session finishes its turn |
| `nativeNotifications` | `true` | Native macOS notification on limit/waiting |
| `stuckAlertMinutes` | `5` | Alert when a working session is silent this long (0 = off) |
| `cpuHogThreshold` | `60` | CPU% above which a session is flagged 🔥 |
| `resumeAutoType` | `true` | Auto-type resume + Enter (needs Accessibility) |
| `resumePrompt` | `"resume"` | Text typed during a resume sweep |
| `resumeStaggerSeconds` | `60` | Seconds between sessions in a resume sweep |
| `resourceSampleMs` | `3000` | CPU/RAM sampling interval |
| `pollIntervalMs` | `1500` | Status refresh interval |
| `recentScanMaxAgeHours` | `6` | Show sessions active within the last N hours |
| `hideEndedAfterMinutes` | `30` | Hide ended sessions after this long |
| `workspaceOnly` | `false` | Only show this workspace's sessions |
